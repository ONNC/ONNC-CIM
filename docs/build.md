# Build & Test from source

You can build onnc source with either [CMake](#building-with-cmake) or [Automake](#building-with-automake) building system.

# Building with CMake

There are 2 modes, [Release mode](#release-mode) and [debug mode](#debug-mode), provided in CMake building system. 

## Release mode

> Recommended for common use.

Release mode will build onnc with basic optimizations, and skip debug informations.

**Notice: Release mode will NOT build unit tests.**

### Step 1: Configure

```shell
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

It will create `build` directory, get into it and configure with `Release` build type.

### Step 2: Build

```shell
$ make -j4
```

It will compile sources with 4 threads concurrently. You can modify `-j4` option to meet your needs.

### Step 3: Install

```shell
$ sudo make install
```

It will install essential files to `/usr/local`.

## Debug mode

> Recommended for development use.

Debug mode will build onnc with debug settings, unit tests and some debug informations.

### Step 1: Configure

```shell
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

It will create `build` directory, get into it and configure with `Debug` build type.

### Step 2: Build

```shell
$ make -j4
```

It will compile sources with 4 threads concurrently. You can modify `-j4` option to meet your needs.

### Step 3: Test

```shell
$ ctest
```

It will trigger all unit tests by CTest.

If you want to execute single unit test, you can find it in `build/tools/unittests` directory.

### Step 4: Install

```shell
$ sudo make install
```

It will install essential files to `/usr/local`.

## Advanced configurations

You can override default configurations by simply add `-DENTRY=VALUE` options to the configure command. The `ENTRY` and `VALUE` can be replaced according to the following table:

"Path string" of value means you have to provide a string of a directory path, and "File path string" means you have to provide a string of a file path.

|ENABLE_CLOCK_GETTIME| `ON`,`OFF` | `OFF` | Whether to enable `clock_gettime` function |
|ENABLE_GETTIMEOFDAY| `ON`,`OFF` | `ON` | Whether to enable `gettimeofday` function |
|ENABLE_PTHREAD| `ON`,`OFF` | `ON` | Whether to enable pthread |
|ENABLE_UNITTEST| `ON`,`OFF` | `ON` | Whether to build unit test |
|ENABLE_WERROR| `ON`,`OFF` | `OFF` | Whether to use `-Werror` flag |
|USE_MKLDNN| `ON`,`OFF` | `ON` | Whether to use MKLDNN for libonnc-rt |

Use `cmake -L ..` inside `build` directory to get more detailed options.
